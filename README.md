# Memory Card Game
Click and match the cards!

If cards don't match they will have a red background. If they do match the cards will have a green background and a short animation triggers.

## General
The start code had been provided by Udacity. I have also kept the background image, but I changed the name of the CSS file. Styling the elements didn't cause me any problems, but programming everything with JavaScript was very tricky for me. I have researched a lot on forums I've found while searching on Google. Still I learned a lot about implementing and using JavaScript to get more live into my code.
